# Time.now() == 7min ->timeisup!

# naming acceptance ... again!~~~
# No Readme file ~~~
# End goal of the app ~~~
# add a timer feature ~~~
# is this going to stay a CLI, gem, rails app feature? Forward direction? ~~

# introduce helper spec~
# separate implementation from script~
# organizing cli vs unit specs ~
# Common structure for running tests
# our 'clean state' isnt that clean. Lots of duplicate files from before



# DONE adding remove mobster feature ----
# naming the acteptance---
# add timer feature---
# refactor to dependency injection --
# seperating implementation from the script --
# connect the app with ruby lobby api * -
# add new api via CLI-
# introducing helper_spec(moving)-

# do we keep features that are done or move to changelog?
# focus on refactoring vs adding features?
# adding directory structure
