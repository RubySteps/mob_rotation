Break functions out of mob_rotation.rb (God class)
clean up directory structure...**
do all the tests pass???****
understand what it actually does...?
play firecrackers whenever we rotate ***
prevent non-driver from interacting w/ terminal
get more information / permissions about participants (class-based?)
include the project history in README
create a README********
abandon this and move on to something
start a new project
build a browser-based gui
randomize driver / navigator (with limits) **
record a history of rotation
designated driver



TODO
- Unrecognized commands show help DONE
- Timer! *

Fails: ruby mob_rotation asdf cows

Add/remove multiple mobsters in one call**
Timer ****
Detect mobsters
Tmux integration: powerline *


# Time.now() == 7min ->timeisup!

# naming acceptance ... again!~~~
# No Readme file ~~~
# End goal of the app ~~~
# add a timer feature ~~~
# is this going to stay a CLI, gem, rails app feature? Forward direction? ~~

# introduce helper spec~
# separate implementation from script~
# organizing cli vs unit specs ~
# Common structure for running tests
# our 'clean state' isnt that clean. Lots of duplicate files from before



# DONE adding remove mobster feature ----
# naming the acteptance---
# add timer feature---
# refactor to dependency injection --
# seperating implementation from the script --
# connect the app with ruby lobby api * -
# add new api via CLI-
# introducing helper_spec(moving)-

# do we keep features that are done or move to changelog?
# focus on refactoring vs adding features?
# adding directory structure

# DONE show mobster should display who navigates and who is driver ****
# DONE method to add
# remove mobsters ***
# remove dependency to / with file ***
# DONE give the describe block a name **
# operating on standard out... would it be worth it to refactor? **
# DONE change it statement... don't know what the subject is *

# --------

# store more mata data in db file(rotation time...)
# write specs for next method rotate?
# how important is it really?
# could change spec to add more meaning
# removing time_to_rotate
